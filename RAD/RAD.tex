 \section*{\color{black}Purpose}

 The results of the requirements elicitation and the analysis activities are documented in the Requirements Analysis Document (RAD). This document completely describes the system in terms of functional and nonfunctional requirements and serves as a contractual basis between the client and the developers.

 % Set the Table of Contents depth and inert the ToC.

 \section{Introduction}
 % Content: The Introduction provides a brief overview of the function of the system and the reasons for its development, its scope, and references to the development context. The introduction also includes the objectives and success criteria of the project.

 \subsection{Purpose of the system}

 \subsection{Scope of the system}

 \subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}

 \subsection{Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations}



 \section{Proposed system}
 % This section documents the requirements elicitation and the analysis model of the new system.

 \subsection{Overview}
 % The overview presents a functional overview of the system.

 \subsection{Functional requirements}
 % Functional requirements describe the high-level functionality of the system. This section list all functional requirements and additionally presents the dependencies between them.

 \subsection{Nonfunctional requirements}
 % Nonfunctional requirements describe user-level requirements that are not directly related to functionality. This includes usability, reliability, performance, supportability, implementation, interface, operational, packaging, and legal requirements. The section list all these non-functional requirements and additionally presents the dependencies between them.

 \subsection{System models}
 % The System models include scenarios, use cases, and the analysis object model for the system. This section should contain the complete functional specification, including mock-ups, paper-based prototypes or storyboards illustrating the user interface of the system and navigational paths representing the sequence of screens.

 \subsubsection{Scenarios}
% NOTE: You may find a table snippet at the end of this document.

 \subsubsection{Use case model}
% NOTE: You may find a figure snippet at the end of this document.

 \subsubsection{Analysis object model}
% NOTE: You may find a figure snippet at the end of this document.

 \subsubsection{User interface mockups}
% NOTE: You may find a figure snippet at the end of this document.



 \section{Glossary}
 % A glossary of important terms used in the project and in the system model ensures consistency in the specification and a common understanding of terms used by the client.
% NOTE: You may find a description list snippet at the end of this document.
